Backyard Worlds: Planet 9

Here I deposit the images and the code

The images from the https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/backyard-worlds-planet-9/ are included.

A Python + OpenCV algorithm is applied to these four images.

And the differences between image A and image B are found.

NOTE:

    Applies to any image.
